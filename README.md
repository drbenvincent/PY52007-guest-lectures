This repository holds teaching content for my guest lectures on the PY52007 Advanced Quantitative Statistics module.

### Note to self
Jupyter notebooks can be converted to `.html` presentations at the command line with someting like:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert Bayesian_Inference.ipynb --to slides
```
